  <h1>Accountability & Red Flags</h1>

  <p>This scene is supposed to be safer, softer, and more intentional than the world outside. But we’re not immune to harm just because we say “PLUR.”</p>

  <h2>🛑 What Accountability Actually Means</h2>
  <p>Accountability isn't public shaming or cancellation. It’s making space for growth, repair, and sometimes walking the fuck away. It’s about care, boundaries, and making sure the same harm doesn’t keep happening unchecked.</p>

  <h2>🚩 Red Flags in the Scene</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>“That’s just how they are” used as an excuse for shitty behavior</li>
    <li>Older people preying on younger/newer ravers</li>
    <li>Predators hiding behind popularity or community status</li>
    <li>People who are never sober and always touching people</li>
    <li>One person or crew trying to control access, bookings, or relationships</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧼 Accountability ≠ Cancellation</h2>
  <p>We’re not here to destroy people. We’re here to keep each other safe. That means clear boundaries, real conversations, and shared values—not exile for clout.</p>

  <h2>🔧 What We Do at PLURderapolis</h2>
  <p>We hold our people to a standard. If someone harms someone else, we pause, we investigate, and we respond. That might look like support, education, space, or removal—depending on what happened and how they show up after. No empty “community responses.” Real action. Always.</p>
