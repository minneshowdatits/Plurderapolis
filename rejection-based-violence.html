      <p>Someone doesn't have to be in a relationship to experience dating violence. Sometimes, the harm begins after a boundary is set. After someone says "no" to dating, sex, or connection, and the other person refuses to accept it.</p>

      <p>This is <span class="highlight">rejection-based violence</span>, and it's dangerously common. It isn't just bruises and screaming matches. It can be soft. Quiet. Stretched out over weeks or months. But it builds — and sometimes, it kills.</p>

      <p><strong>That's what happened to Kayli Arseth.</strong> She was not in a relationship with the man who murdered her. She had made it clear she wasn't interested. He kept pushing. She said no again. He waited for her in her apartment and took her life.</p>

      <p><strong>Kayli Grace Arseth</strong>, 22, was murdered in her Richfield apartment on June 16, 2025, by a man she had clearly and repeatedly told she wasn't interested in.</p>
      <p>Kayli was vibrant, compassionate, and deeply loved. She had a light about her that made people feel seen, safe, and understood. She worked with children as a Behavioral Technician and had recently made the decision to pursue a degree in Developmental Psychology. She believed in making the world kinder — especially for those who needed it most.</p>
      <p>She loved art, music, and riding her motorcycle. She found joy in creativity and connection. She was the kind of friend who showed up. The kind of person who danced freely at shows, laughed loudly, and held people close without judgment. She was a regular in our scene. Someone who just wanted to live, love, and grow.</p>
      <p><strong>Kayli deserved peace. She deserved to be respected. She deserved to be safe. She deserved to be here.</strong></p>
