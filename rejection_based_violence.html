<h1>🔊 When “No” Isn’t Respected: Recognize, Interrupt, and Prevent Rejection-Based Violence 📢</h1>

<section>
  <p>Someone doesn’t have to be in a relationship to experience dating violence. Sometimes, the harm begins after a boundary is set—after someone says “no” to dating, sex, or connection, and the other person refuses to accept it.</p>
  <p>This is <strong>rejection-based violence</strong>, and it’s dangerously common. It isn’t just bruises and screaming matches. It can be soft. Quiet. Stretched out over weeks or months. But it builds—and sometimes, it kills.</p>
  <p><strong>That’s what happened to Kayli Arseth.</strong> She was not in a relationship with the man who murdered her. She had made it clear she wasn’t interested. He kept pushing. She said no again. He waited for her in her apartment, and took her life.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🚩 What Rejection-Based Violence Can Look Like:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>They won’t stop messaging, calling, or contacting you after you’ve said no.</li>
    <li>They show up at your work, home, or events without being invited.</li>
    <li>They use guilt trips, gifts, or emotional manipulation to wear you down.</li>
    <li>They talk about you like you’re owed to them: “I did everything for you,” “You led me on.”</li>
    <li>They try to isolate you from friends, family, or community.</li>
    <li>They escalate after rejection: stalking, threats, breaking in—or worse.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🧠 Psychological Truths Behind This Pattern:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Narcissistic entitlement:</strong> Believing they “deserve” a relationship, no matter your wishes.</li>
    <li><strong>Cognitive dissonance:</strong> Rejection challenges their fantasy. Some react with control or violence.</li>
    <li><strong>Power and control > love:</strong> It’s not about romance. It’s about domination.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>👁️‍🗨️ Signs It Might Be Happening To You:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You feel anxious or unsafe after setting clear boundaries.</li>
    <li>You’re hiding your location, avoiding routines or certain places.</li>
    <li>You second guess whether you were “clear enough.” (You were.)</li>
    <li>They blame you for their emotions or threats.</li>
    <li>You said no—and they’re still texting, still showing up, still pushing.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="highlight">
  <p><strong>You don’t owe anyone your peace, your body, or your time.</strong> Saying “no” doesn’t make you cruel. Setting boundaries doesn’t make you responsible for someone else’s meltdown.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🔐 What To Do If You Think It’s Happening To You:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Trust your gut. No bruise needed to know it’s wrong.</li>
    <li>Tell someone you trust. Don’t do this alone.</li>
    <li>Save messages, screenshots, voicemails—build a record.</li>
    <li>Adjust privacy settings online. Be mindful of what you share.</li>
    <li>Make a plan: where to go, who to call, what feels safe.</li>
    <li>Use support resources. (See below.)</li>
    <li>Don’t blame yourself. You’re allowed to leave. You didn’t cause this.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>👀 Signs It Might Be Happening to Someone You Know:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>They stop going out, posting, or replying to messages.</li>
    <li>They seem nervous when a certain name comes up.</li>
    <li>Someone talks bitterly or obsessively about being rejected.</li>
    <li>There’s a “friend” around all the time, even uninvited.</li>
    <li>Control or stalking gets disguised as “romance” or “worry.”</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>✊ What To Do If You Notice It:</h2>
  <h3>If a friend might be targeted:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>“You seem stressed when [Name] comes up. I’m here.”</li>
    <li>Offer support with no pressure or judgment.</li>
    <li>Respect their pace. Naming it is hard.</li>
    <li>Stay consistent. Isolation makes everything worse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If you witness harassment or stalking:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Distract:</strong> Interrupt or shift the scene.</li>
    <li><strong>Delegate:</strong> Ask someone else to step in.</li>
    <li><strong>Document:</strong> Only if it’s safe to do so.</li>
    <li><strong>Delay:</strong> Check in after. Make sure they’re okay.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct:</strong> If safe: “She said no. Back off.”</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>❓🧍‍♂️ What If It’s Your Friend Crossing the Line?</h2>
  <p>It’s not always strangers. Sometimes it’s our people. Holding them accountable is not betrayal—it’s harm reduction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“She said she’s not interested. You need to respect that.”</li>
    <li>“This is obsession, not love. You gotta chill.”</li>
    <li>“If someone kept texting you after a ‘no,’ you’d hate that too.”</li>
    <li>“Showing up uninvited is harassment, not romance.”</li>
    <li>“You’re not owed a relationship for being ‘nice.’”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Call them in—before they ruin someone’s life or their own. This is how we protect our community.</p>

  <h2>🖤 In Memory of Kayli Arseth</h2>
  <p>Kayli Grace Arseth, 22, was murdered in her Richfield apartment on June 16, 2025, by a man she had clearly told she wasn’t interested in.</p>
  <p>Kayli was vibrant, compassionate, and deeply loved. She worked with children as a Behavioral Technician and had just decided to pursue a degree in Developmental Psychology. She loved art, music, and riding her motorcycle. She was the kind of friend who showed up and held people close.</p>
  <p>Kayli deserved peace. She deserved to be respected. She deserved to be safe. She deserved to be here.</p>
