  <section id="about">
    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>PLURderapolis is the digital evolution of a decade-long harm reduction movement that started on the dance floors of the Midwest.</p>
    <p>Our roots go back to <strong>MinneShowHerMore</strong>, a DIY feminist crew that showed up to shows with info tables, Narcan, and safety planning resources before it was trendy — or accepted.</p>
    <p>We’ve worked booths, handed out condoms, kept people safe through overdoses, and heard the worst stories people never wanted to tell.</p>
    <p>Back then, we even kept track of known abusers in the scene. That work shaped how we listen, how we act, and how we now help people spot red flags and protect each other — before it gets that far.</p>
    <p>Now we’ve taken that experience online, because that’s where the danger — and the opportunity — lives.</p>
    <p>We’re not trying to be the cops of the rave scene. We’re just the people who give a shit.</p>
