    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>PLURderapolis is the digital evolution of a harm reduction movement built from years of underground, grassroots work.</p>
    <p>Our roots go back to <strong>MinneShowHerMore</strong>, a DIY feminist crew who showed up with info tables, Narcan, and safety planning at Midwest shows before it was mainstream or easy.</p>
    <p>We‚Äôve worked booths, handed out condoms, kept people safe from overdoses, and heard the darkest stories people never wanted to tell.</p>
    <p>Back then, we kept track of known abusers in the scene. That shaped how we listen and act now ‚Äî helping people spot red flags and protect each other before it gets that far.</p>
    <p>Now, we focus on the online spaces where the scene lives, so harm prevention and healing can reach more people faster.</p>
    <p>We‚Äôre not here to be the cops of the rave scene ‚Äî we‚Äôre just the people who give a shit.</p>
